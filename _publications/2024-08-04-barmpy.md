Abstract: We make Bayesian additive regression networks (BARN) available as a Python package, barmpy, with documentation at https://dvbuntu.github.io/barmpy/ for general machine learning practitioners. Our object-oriented design is compatible with SciKit-Learn, allowing usage of their tools like cross-validation. To ease learning to use barmpy, we produce a companion tutorial that expands on reference information in the documentation. Any interested user can pip install barmpy from the official PyPi repository. barmpy also serves as a baseline Python library for generic Bayesian additive regression models.
