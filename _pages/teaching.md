I have extensive experience teaching in both traditional and non-traditional classrooms.  Most recently, I've taught coursework in Python programming as well as Data Science.  I have also written, recorded, and produced video courses in machine learning with neural networks.  Please reach out for a more detailed statement on my teaching philosophy.
