This is the academic website of Danielle Van Boxel.  She's a PhD Student in the [University of Arizona Applied Math GIDP](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/).  Her research focuses on new methods in machine learning and data science.  See more at [Research](https://dvbuntu.github.io/research).

Note that I used to publish under a different first name (same initial).  Thankfully, my last name is rare enough that something by "D. Van Boxel" in the United States since 2007 was likely me.
