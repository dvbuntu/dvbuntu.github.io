This is the academic website of Danielle Van Boxel.  She's a PhD grad of the [University of Arizona Applied Math GIDP](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/).  Her research focuses on new methods in machine learning and data science.

# Welcome!

I enjoy research in many fields of mathematics.  By chance or by fate, I have done most of my research in machine learning.  Originally I was a traffic engineer, but have long since generalized to arbitrary data sets.  In addition to studying new methods in machine learning, I also enjoy analyzing data sets.  Every data set has a story, and part of that story is what mistakes or obfuscations exist in it.  Teasing those out is a delightful puzzle.

Note that I used to publish under a different first name (same initial).  Thankfully, my last name is rare enough that something by "D. Van Boxel" in the United States since 2007 was likely me.
