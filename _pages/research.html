I enjoy research in many fields of mathematics.  By chance or by fate, I have done most of my research in machine learning.  Originally I was a traffic engineer, but have long since generalized to arbitrary data sets.  In addition to studying new methods in machine learning, I also enjoy analyzing data sets.  Every data set has a story, and part of that story is what mistakes or obfuscations exist in it.  Teasing those out is a delightful puzzle.
